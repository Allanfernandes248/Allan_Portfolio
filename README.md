## [Optimizing Delivery Charges for Ecommerce Company - Python, Microsoft Excel ](https://github.com/Allanfernandes248/Optimizing-Delivery-Charges-for-Ecommerce-Company)
-You are a data analyst and have a large ecommerce company in India (letâ€™s call it X) as a client. X gets a few thousand orders via their website on a daily basis and they have to deliver them as fast as they can. For delivering the goods ordered by the customers, X has tied up with multiple courier companies in India who charge them some amount per delivery. As the amount that X has to pay to the courier companies is very high, **they want to verify if the
charges levied by their partners per Order are correct.**
- Created a separate summary sheet detailing the count and total amount of correctly charged, overcharged, and undercharged orders for 400 number of orders.
-  Found that 80% of orders were being overpriced by courier partners. Implemented changes that resulted in a 52% reduction in delivery costs for the company.


## [GetTaxi-Insights From Failed Orders - Python, BigQuery, SQL](https://github.com/Allanfernandes248/Stratascratch_insights_from_failed_orders)
**Extracted useful insights from a 10,000 datapoint using BigQuery Client API.Insights generated are as follows:**
- Build up distribution of orders according to reasons for failure: cancellations before and after driver assignment, and reasons for order rejection. Analyse the resulting plot. Which category has the highest number of orders?
- Plot the distribution of failed orders by hours. Is there a trend that certain hours have an abnormally high proportion of one category or another? What hours are the biggest fails? How can this be explained?
- Plot the average time to cancellation with and without driver, by the hour. If there are any outliers in the data, it would be better to remove them. Can we draw any conclusions from this plot?
- Plot the distribution of average ETA by hours. How can this plot be explained?

## [Walmart Store Analysis - Python](https://github.com/Allanfernandes248/Walmart-Store-Analysis)

- Extracted sales data of 40+ Walmart stores and determined which Walmart locations are performing best and worst. The analytics was done using Python. 
-	Found that weekly sales during holiday weeks showed a 7.84% increase compared to non-holiday weeks. Proposed that low-performing stores focus on improving marketing strategies during holiday weeks to increase sales.
-	Observed that stores with higher fuel prices had higher sales compared to stores with lower fuel prices. Proposed that this may be due to the higher income levels in areas with high fuel prices, as showed by the 2.35% higher unemployment rate in low-performing stores.
-	Found that the average temperature in top-performing stores was 58.49 units, while the average temperature in bottom-performing stores was 66.61 units. Proposed that the ideal temperature in top-performing stores may be a factor in customer visits and suggested that this be considered when setting up new strategic Walmart stores in the future near the vicinity.



## [BigBasket Analysis - Microsoft Power BI](https://github.com/Allanfernandes248/BigBasketAnalysis)

- Imported Data from Kaggle.
- Used Python to analyse and clean the data using Pandas library.
- Exported the cleaned and segregated data into different sheets into a new excel file.
- Used this new excel file for creating dashboards in Power BI.
- Created an interactive dashboard and summarised the analysis into 7 KPIs.
